I decided to start a new project and named it "OUK". Ouk stands for
Oracle Utilities Kit.

Ouk is also is a letter of the early Cyrillic alphabet
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouk

The collection of utility scripts has two primary purposes: it would
help to establish, hopefully, a good stash of scripts, which can be
useful for Oracle develpers and administrators as well as to illustrate
somewhat proper coding and usage practice of Oracle SQL*Plus -- the
most simple (yet powerful) tool one can use to develop projects and
manage an Oracle database.

All utility scripts, code snippets, ideas on algorithms, data access
and processing imply NO WARRANTY and can be used "AS IS" with appropriate
credits. :-)
